//! # `botfair` 0.3.1
//!
//! The `botfair` crate provides Rust bindings for the Betfair SportsAPING.
//! Login and keep-alive are handled automatically by the BFClient.
//!
//! See the [`BFClient`](BFClient) documentation for methods.
//!
//! [`BFClient`](BFClient) implements Sync and so can safely be wrapped in an
//! Arc for multithreaded use with the same session token.
//!
//! ## Warranty
//!
//! ```text
//! This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
//!    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
//!    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
//! ```
//!
//! Paid support, consulting, and contracting services are available.
//!
//! For more information, contact Daniel Edgecumbe at
//! <botfair@esotericnonsense.com>.
//!
//! ## Example
//! Note that `botfair` requires your certificate to be in `pfx` format.
//! In order to achieve this given a key and crt file, you can use the
//! following openssl command:
//!
//! ```text
//! openssl pkcs12 -export -out client.pfx \
//!     -inkey client.key -in client.crt
//! ```
//!
//! `botfair` assumes no password protection for the `pfx` file.
//!
//!
//! ## Generating the bindings
//!
//! If you just want to use the crate, you can skip this section as the
//! bindings are already present.
//!
//! To re-generate the bindings from the Betfair XML documentation, you will
//! need to `cd genapi; ./main.sh` which fetches the documentation from
//! Betfair's servers and runs a python script on them to generate the Rust
//! bindings.
//!
//! ## License
//!
//! For open source software, `botfair` is subject to the GNU AGPLv3, contained
//! in the document LICENSE.AGPLv3 which should be distributed with the
//! software.
//!
//! This means that you need to licence your software under the same terms. In
//! particular, this means that software that makes use of this library must
//! make available its' source code to the users of said software, whether that
//! software is interacted with over a network or by the end users directly.
//!
//! For closed source software, exceptions may be made at the discretion of the
//! author.
