Login and keep-alive are handled automatically by the BFClient.

## Usage
Note that `botfair` requires your certificate to be in `pfx` format.

In order to achieve this given a key and crt file, you can use the following
openssl command:

```
openssl pkcs12 -export -out client.pfx \
    -inkey client.key -in client.crt
```

`botfair` assumes no password protection for the `pfx` file.

```
let bf_creds = BFCredentials::new(
    "my_username".to_owned(),
    "my_password".to_owned(),
    "/path/to/pfx/file".to_owned(),
    "my_appkey".to_owned()
).unwrap();

let bf_client = BFClient::new(
    bf_creds,
    None
).unwrap();

// This is all rather verbose at the moment.
// What will the future bring?
let market_filter = MarketFilter {
    textQuery: None,
    exchangeIds: None,
    eventTypeIds: None,
    eventIds: None,
    competitionIds: None,
    marketIds: None,
    venues: None,
    bspOnly: None,
    turnInPlayEnabled: None,
    inPlayOnly: None,
    marketBettingTypes: None,
    marketCountries: None,
    marketTypeCodes: None,
    marketStartTime: None,
    withOrders: None,
    raceTypes: None,
};

// List ten arbitrary markets
let catalogues: Vec<MarketCatalogue> =
    bf_client.listMarketCatalogue(market_filter, None, None, 10, None)?;

println!("{:?}", catalogues);
```

## Generating the bindings

If you just want to use the crate, you can skip this section as the bindings
are already present.

To re-generate the bindings from the Betfair XML documentation, you will need
to `cd genapi; ./main.sh` which fetches the documentation from Betfair's
servers and runs a python script on them to generate the Rust bindings.
